haskell-reversi
===============

A Reversi (technically Othello) engine written in Haskell during winter break 2014.

You play as white against the computer (black). Enter the square you want to move to in chess notation, e.g. d6.

Dependencies: game-tree and timeit -- available from Hackage. Simple build: type "ghc *.hs -O2" while in haskell-reversi folder.

Use/change this as you like. Nothing guaranteed.
